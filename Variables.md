### Day 2. Variables 

### Variables in Shell Scripting 

- **What are Variables?**
  - Variables are like containers where you can store information (values) such as numbers, characters, or strings (a series of characters).
  
- **Creating Variables**
  - Variables are created when you assign a value to them.
  - Example: `name="Pranav"`

- **Variable Naming Rules**
  - **Case-sensitive**: This means `NAME` and `name` are treated as different variables.
  - Can only include letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and the underscore (`_`).
  - The variable name **cannot start with a number**.

- **Assigning Values**
  - You use the `=` sign to assign a value to a variable.
  - No spaces are allowed before or after the `=` sign.
  - Example: `age=25` is correct, but `age = 25` is wrong.

- **Examples**
  ```bash
  name="John"   # Correct
  number=123    # Correct
  greeting="Hello, World!"  # Correct
  ``` 

These are the basic things you need to know about variables in shell scripting!
