## Day 1. Basics

In a Bash script, the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) is the very first line that tells the system what interpreter to use to run the script.

- `#!` is called the "shebang."
- `/bin/bash` is the path to the Bash shell.

When you run the script, the system reads this line and uses the specified interpreter (in this case, Bash) to execute the commands in the script. So, it tells the system: "Hey, use Bash to run everything in this file!"


## echo command 

To print the line "Hello, World!" using the `echo` command in a Bash script or the terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

This will output:

```
Hello, World!
```
